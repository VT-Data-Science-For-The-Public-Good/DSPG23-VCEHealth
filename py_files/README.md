# Mathematical Programming Model via PuLP

## Instructions

1. Create a directory for this project. Within this directory, include a folder called *data* in which you will store the data files in the *data_inputs* folder included here, and a folder called *results* where the models will store their outputs.
2. You need to ensure that all required modules are installed. These include:
  * **pulp** for implementing the mathematical programming model
  * **matplotlib** for plotting
  * **numpy** for computation
  * **pandas** for handling data
3. Update the project directory as appropriate on line 12 of each python script.
4. Run the models!
